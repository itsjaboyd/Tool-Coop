Diagonal pliers (or wire cutters or diagonal cutting pliers or diagonal cutters or side cutting pliers) are pliers intended for the cutting of wire (they are generally not used to grab or turn anything). The plane defined by the cutting edges of the jaws intersects the joint rivet at an angle or "on a diagonal", hence the name.
