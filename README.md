## Organization & Name Scheme

## Version Control Procedures
git will be used for version control, with our repository on github
### Git Workflow
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow
This project will use the git feature branch workflow. The basic idea of this is that you never make commits to master. You checkout a different branch for each individual feature, make commits to that branch. Push it to origin. Then make a pull request on github. Then the branch will be merged to master.
As far as branch naming conventions go we should stick to lower case with dashes separating words. try and make branch names as descriptive as you can.
